 - Cause the redskins are more important to him than fantasy

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 5:42:50 PM

* Jorge Grimm  - 5:43:27 PM

* Jorge Grimm  - 10:54:30 PM
 - Don't forget, the lowest score each week pays 10 bucks to loser pot.  

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:14:12 PM
 - And the Sloot is very likely gonna lose to a team that has no qb.... 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:22:06 PM

 - Too close for comfort!

 - And no one did as bad as Peter this week

* Joe Stew  - 1:28:19 AM

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:28:23 AM
 - I'm also going to lose by 1.6 pts in my Port City league. FML. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 1:28:25 AM

* Eirik Ailee  - 1:28:39 AM

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:39:49 AM

* Jorge Grimm  - 1:41:37 AM

* Eirik Ailee  - 1:42:36 AM
 - Specifically to the entire nfc east 4 years in a row...

 - More importantly, who's dezray18, Ali? Haha

* Ali Mehrad  - 2:08:27 AM
 - Lol Insta gram pic 

* Eirik Ailee  - 2:13:46 AM
 - I think its a little unfair for ray rizzle. Im not sayin go hit ladies at all but she clearly was antagonizing him. Im not sayin she deserved it, or hes right for doing it. Just sayin, she threw the first two punches on tape. She just missed. If ray rizzle got knocked out cold in that elevator it would be a different story... rather not one at all. Seems kinda not equal/fair to me

* Jorge Grimm  - 2:16:27 AM
 - In other words don't fuck with ray rice. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 2:16:40 AM
 - True but u just can't hit a woman. He's a jacked NFL player smacking a 100 lb defenseless woman. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 2:17:03 AM
 - It doesn't look good any way you slice it. 

* Peter Grimm  - 2:19:56 AM
 - There is no excuse. He gets beat up for a living. He's a RB in the NFL. You're telling me he couldn't take a few punches from a lady?! He knocked her out cold!

* Eirik Ailee  - 2:24:46 AM
 - I feel you chris and peter, i do. I just believe men and womem are complete equals. It just crosses the line of equality between them. Having it be you cant do this, because they are blank means by definition they arent equal.

* Joe Stew  - 4:29:30 PM
 - Any of you clowns want Grouplove tickets for this Friday? They were 56 each after fees I'm selling them for 45 each.  I'll come down a little lower but not
Much

* Eirik Ailee  - 4:30:58 PM
 - Whats grouplove? Are you paying for an orgy? Newb

* Ben Dennis  - 4:34:32 PM
 - Total rookie move.

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:50:36 PM
 - I can't wait to rosterbate when josh Gordon gets reinstated.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:26:52 PM
 - He's done. 

* Joe Stew  - 1:27:11 PM
 - He looks like he's in a lot of pain

* Joe Stew  - 1:27:13 PM
 - Damn

* Ben Dennis  - 1:27:33 PM
 - I think it's his ankle.

* Ben Dennis  - 1:27:40 PM
 - He could be alright.

* Joe Stew  - 1:28:29 PM
 - He was playing really well

* Joe Stew  - 1:28:30 PM
 - Go Kirk cousins

* Ben Dennis  - 1:30:06 PM
 - Oh shit. He's already in a cast... Carted off and crying. Never good news.

* Joe Stew  - 1:30:58 PM
 - Is that the same leg he hurt the first time?

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:31:24 PM
 - That sucks. Cousins throws a TD with first throw. Wow. 

* Ben Dennis  - 1:31:46 PM
 - No.

* Eirik Ailee  - 1:32:28 PM
 - Nope the other one. I think its ankle too

* Eirik Ailee  - 1:32:43 PM
 - By the way rg3 needs to give mr garrisons balls back

* Ali Mehrad  - 1:32:47 PM
 - Nope knee 

* Ali Mehrad  - 1:32:55 PM
 - He had an air cast on 

* Ben Dennis  - 1:33:32 PM
 - Air cast usually implies ankle.

* Ali Mehrad  - 1:34:03 PM
 - Around knee?

 - Siiiiigh

* Eirik Ailee  - 1:35:22 PM
 - There goes desean. Looks like a dislocated shoulder piece

* Ben Dennis  - 1:36:25 PM
 - Let's hope for a separation rather than a dislocation.

* Ben Dennis  - 1:40:11 PM
 - Redskins just confirmed ankle on RG3.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:48:04 PM
 - Spiller hurt too but who's surprised by that?

* Joe Stew  - 1:48:08 PM

* Joe Stew  - 1:48:16 PM

 - Matt Ryan needs to step his shit up

* Eirik Ailee  - 2:23:27 PM
 - Too high. You cant hit the head piece. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 2:26:27 PM

* Ben Dennis  - 11:39:09 PM
 - Green couldn't even bring himself to show up for the Jags, who fuckin blow. And Donald Brown can't even step up when our 2 other RBs are injured. Despite the beat down we put on that pathetic excuse for a team. Fuck.

* Joe Stew  - 7:36:27 PM
 - Megatron is in the shop and Kyle Orton goes from
Couch potato to hero.  

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 7:37:10 PM
 - Dan Carpenter is the hero here. Orton helped, but damn. 58 yards?!

* Joe Stew  - 7:38:55 PM
 - Kyle Orton had 300 yards

* Joe Stew  - 7:39:04 PM
 - But also great kick

* Joe Stew  - 7:39:09 PM
 - And I just read about the laser pointer

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 7:39:25 PM
 - Don't get me wrong, he's ridiculously better than EJ Manuel. But Carpenter kicked it. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 7:42:10 PM
 - Oh wow I just read that. That's nuts. We all wondered why he was arguing with the officials after the kick. 

* Me - 8:07:00 PM
 - There is not even ONE other person that is working tonight that I can talk fantasy football with. You are all off any you all suck

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:10:58 PM
 - Haha that sucks. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:14:45 PM
 - You're getting housed tho Tron. And me thinks NE Defense isn't going to get it done for you tonight...

* Joe Stew  - 8:16:41 PM
 - Tron isn't used to losing. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:16:51 PM
 - Last year he went undefeated till
The last week

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:17:05 PM
 - A strong run. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:17:32 PM
 - Kind of like the train I ran on your mom

* Eirik Ailee  - 8:18:06 PM
 - I was there

* Joe Stew  - 8:19:01 PM
 - Eirik your brothers roommate is a manager at downtown and he sucks

* Joe Stew  - 8:19:19 PM
 - An doesn't smoke pot apparently.  Idk how that works

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:20:17 PM
 - Better than 45 points this week, Eirik. Not bad. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:23:16 PM
 - What kind of comeback is that! You don't give props after someone said they watched your mom get train run on her while maybe also admitting that he participated in it.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:23:36 PM
 - Deflection. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:24:06 PM
 - I'm too busy winning all my leagues this week to form a response. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:24:23 PM
 - And by leagues I mean winning this week*

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:25:48 PM
 - Ben Dennis has to be the worst fantasy player out league has ever known by the way. Can we just discuss how bad his team is?

* Jorge Grimm  - 8:26:32 PM
 - Bullshit aside... That Julius Thomas Peyton Manning combo thoooooo

* Joe Stew  - 8:26:57 PM
 - Demarius or whatever had over 30 points

* Joe Stew  - 8:27:00 PM
 - Chill

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:27:22 PM
 - There's so much to go around. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:27:41 PM
 - Sloot man Ben Dennis's team may be bad but I wouldn't go about saying anything about it.  I've see him kill rape and pillage humans that speak against him

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:27:43 PM
 - Like Joe's mom. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:27:56 PM
 - He's also probably the coolest person I know

* Joe Stew  - 8:28:12 PM
 - Not in a gay way but like in like you see the guy and you're like he's cool.

* Jorge Grimm  - 8:28:19 PM
 - Joe, that's cute.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:28:38 PM
 - Butt buddies. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:28:46 PM
 - Jorge, you're gay.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:28:48 PM
 - Melissa has no idea. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:30:27 PM
 - That's as far as any Melissa talk goes.  Anyway I hope marshawn and garçon don't combine for
30 points

* Peter Grimm  - 8:30:28 PM
 - Joe. Does Melissa know that you and Ben dock on a weekly basis? Does he cuddle you after you touch dicks?

* Peter Grimm  - 8:31:01 PM
 - All I need is 29 to beat you.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:31:09 PM
 - Haha

* Jorge Grimm  - 8:31:12 PM
 - I cant wait for Ben to read all of this

* Joe Stew  - 8:31:28 PM
 - I can't wait to show that text to Sebastian and see how he feels about you alluding to my sex life via text

* Joe Stew  - 8:31:32 PM
 - Or even the juggernaut Megan McCourt

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:31:46 PM
 - Yeah where is he? Probably wasted having destroyed the hapless Jets. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:32:11 PM
 - You silly fuck! No way you're gonna win!

* Joe Stew  - 8:32:31 PM
 - also if you guys don't know what docking is you should look it up

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:35:20 PM
 - Neither of you are circumsized? The only way to go. 

* Peter Grimm  - 8:35:30 PM
 - Lol!

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:35:59 PM
 - Is it sex if you enter another man's penis?

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:36:10 PM
 - It's not technically a hole right?

* Jorge Grimm  - 8:38:20 PM
 - Space docking

* Jorge Grimm  - 8:38:25 PM
 - Its a thing

* Joe Stew  - 8:38:41 PM

Who the fuck is the dumb ass that set these faggot ass rules? Who the fuck is the pussy ass, cunt piece of shit that snaked him? And how many of you faggot ass fucks are getting the shit kicked out of you for being a part of and propagating this Jerry-rigged, budget-ass, communist league and it's entirely anti-free market rules?

 - Hey Justin. How about you start a qb this week?

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:16:37 PM
 - Hahaha. I hear they aren't really necessary. 

* Peter Grimm  - 1:18:47 PM
 - Its great to have 2 qbs that both have a bye this week.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:19:47 PM
 - He could've started Flacco. 

* Peter Grimm  - 1:21:08 PM
 - True story.

* Peter Grimm  - 1:23:18 PM
 - Hate that I am winning over a technicality. Its a shame.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:24:08 PM
 - I lost to David without him starting a QB. Don't speak so fast. 

* Peter Grimm  - 1:25:12 PM
 - You bring up a good point.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 1:54:43 PM

 - Suck my fucking fantasy hairy gigantic cock and balls, Jorge. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 10:04:39 PM
 - Looks like Joe will be riding solo up top if all stays the way it is now. And everyone else will be even. So much parity this year. So much shittiness on the Prep Set Dre's. Like poopy stink. Like I can smell it from Glover Park. Jorge, your team smells like shit is what I'm saying. Hence, you are shit. You are a piece of dog shit. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 10:38:46 PM
 - Does no one else want to revel in this gloriousness??

* Joe Stew  - 10:48:49 PM
 - Still seven weeks to go but thanks for the shoutout.  And Jorge deserves that for all the shit he talks

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:07:39 PM
 - Justin, you face Jorge next week. Try to start a QB. You have 3 of them. I'll take my cock out of his ass by Thursday so you can slide right in. It's pretty gaping right now. Should be nice and wide by now. 

* Eirik Ailee  - 11:09:28 PM
 - Yeah id totally play justins fantasy defense next week 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:09:39 PM
 - Hahaha

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:11:12 PM
 - Who would want to start Seattle at home though?

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:11:37 PM
 - That seems ludicrous. They always perform poorly at home. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:47:59 PM
 - No comment

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:49:13 PM

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 3:07:22 PM
 - Big Beignets = new Charging Cherries. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 3:08:54 PM
 - I might bench dez on Monday so he doesn't get injured. That's how that works right?

* Joe Stew  - 3:16:49 PM
 - Miami defense wow

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 3:17:45 PM
 - Great start by me. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 3:19:41 PM

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:24:59 PM
 - Sam, thank you for the lovely birthday present. A win and taking over possession of 2nd place?! You're too kind. 

* Joe Stew  - 11:25:42 PM
 - How am I going to lose with 130 points what the fuck

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:26:57 PM
 - This is the first week since 2010 that 6 players have had over 30 points in a week. That's how. 

* Joe Stew  - 11:27:39 PM
 - I guess I had two of them

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:29:53 PM
 - And you still lost....

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:38:26 PM
 - This is the first week where almost everyone scored over 90 points. Nice job everyone. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:39:18 PM
 - Except for you, Peter. You sucked some serious balls this week. 

* Peter Grimm  - 11:41:23 PM
 - Chris. I take back anything nice I have ever said to or about you.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:42:16 PM
 - We all know you've never said anything nice to or about me, Peter. 

* Peter Grimm  - 11:43:04 PM
 - And the redskins won!

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:43:31 PM
 - Sloot. Choke on my wiener 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:44:06 PM
 - It's my friggin birthday, Sam. You can't be mean to me. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:44:17 PM
 - Look at all these peasants arguing at the foot of my throne

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:45:11 PM

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:49:31 PM
 - Fight on fight on till you have won sons of Washington rah rah rah

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:50:08 PM
 - Congrats. You're 3-5. Great job. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:51:16 PM
 - Colt "my boi" McCoy is the answer

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:52:17 PM
 - Does the bandwagon make your sphincter feel good Andrés?

* Peter Grimm  - 11:54:22 PM
 - I don't think a bandwagon would follow any 3-5 team. The Grimms bleed burgundy and gold.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:54:36 PM
 - The mediocre Washington football team. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:54:42 PM
 - It has a certain ring to it. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:55:35 PM
 - 0 for 4

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:55:57 PM
 - It's the colt bandwagon. The redskins are relatively wagonless

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:56:26 PM
 - Hey, Sam! There's one wheel left on it!

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:56:57 PM
 - But I scored the highest 

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:57:06 PM
 - A wooden one...

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:57:06 PM

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:57:08 PM
 - So suck dick Sloot 

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:57:31 PM
 - Ali...nobody gives a FUCK about your goddamn Blue bitches

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:57:32 PM
 - Jump on that big blue bandwagon lol 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:57:58 PM
 - You never responded to my bet offer so you win literally nothing. You literally get a participation trophie. Like the rest of these losers. 

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:58:09 PM
 - I wish I had Reggie Bush...he's had some great games...

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:58:54 PM
 - Trade me oliver the beast 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:59:15 PM
 - Ali, Reggie Bush for clay Harbor. Straight up. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:59:39 PM
 - Who's scored just as much as bush and he's injured lol 


--- Oct 28, 2014 ---
* Sam Kierstead  - 12:01:01 AM
 - That's why you're a dirty lil trade whore trying to offload Reggie on everyone

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 12:01:26 AM
 - Trade rapist. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:02:46 AM

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:02:47 AM
 - Sanders ring a bell 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:02:48 AM
 - I hate you lol 

* Sam Kierstead  - 12:02:51 AM
 - Ya put your dick away Ali. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 12:05:31 AM
 - No one could've foreseen that one coming. But I'm happy to come out on the better end of that deal. Especially bc I literally tried to trade him back to you for Patterson and you denied the trade hahaha. Which makes this even sweeter. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:12:45 AM
 - Haha

 - I thought you were setting a line too.

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:24:39 PM
 - Nope 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:27:16 PM
 - Nope 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:28:14 PM
 - I like the score but not enough to bet on it 

* Sam Kierstead  - 12:32:06 PM

 - If Joe played the same schedule as me, your new #1, he'd be 8-1. Thanks, Yahoo Analytics. Hahaha. Suck it, Joe. Now bow down and kiss my feet my minions!!!!

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:17:56 PM
 - 6 game winning streak bitches. Longest of the season. Suck my gigantic D and medium-sized nuts. 

* Matty Crocket  - 8:18:24 PM
 - You've had the least points scored against you. #lucknotskill

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:19:21 PM
 - It's not my fault your teams suck when u play me. It's your fault for playing inferior players. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:21:39 PM
 - That logic doesn't make sense sloot.  What actually happened is everyone has their worst week against you and their best week against me.  I have the most points in the league.  I'm like Jorge two years ago poised to win and losing by billshit

* Joe Stew  - 8:21:41 PM
 - Every week

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:22:47 PM
 - 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:23:04 PM

 - Original, Eirik. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 8:34:54 PM
 - Yeah eirik its not like they lost 4 in a row....

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:35:00 PM
 - The last time the Skins won was against the fucking Bills. So get over yourself. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:35:16 PM
 - We both suck. I've accepted it. 

* Eirik Ailee  - 8:36:53 PM
 - That was also the last time you gjys went also (give or take 2 years, which at this point lets face it, negligable)

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:43:51 PM
 - Exactly. I've accepted we suck. You and Jorge should accept that you guys also suck balls. At least we're above .500 this year. 

* Eirik Ailee  - 8:44:53 PM
 - Right now you are. Theres time to break even dont worry

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:45:56 PM
 - Lol absolutely true. This is let-down time. 

* Eirik Ailee  - 8:54:13 PM
 - ￼By the way guys i dislocated my knee last month...

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:54:36 PM
 - Haha. Wow dude I'm really sorry. 

* Joe Stew  - 8:57:45 PM
 - Hahahahaha

* Joe Stew  - 8:57:49 PM
 - It took me a second 

* Joe Stew  - 8:57:51 PM
 - But that's great

* Jorge Grimm  - 9:01:14 PM
 - Aahhahahaahhahah

* Ben Dennis  - 9:05:49 PM
 - Naw dude, that implant on the knee cap is a little strange.

 - Ali, let this trade go through. Don't be a Hitler. A Mussolini. A Stalin.  

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:17:19 PM
 - You're such a piece of shit. You don't want it to go through bc you're playing Peter. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:17:23 PM
 - Rules are rules my friend 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:17:42 PM
 - It's before the deadline. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:17:48 PM
 - I told you two days ago 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:18:06 PM
 - No 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:18:41 PM
 - Deadline was Tuesday nov. 12 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:18:41 PM
 - Ali, the trade end date is Nov 14. That's tmrw. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:19:02 PM
 - You're a piece of shit. It says in the league settings November 14th. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:19:20 PM
 - I told you the 12 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:19:30 PM
 - Yes or no? 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:19:41 PM
 - Answer the question yes or no

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:19:52 PM
 - Let it go through or I'll lead a revolt. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:20:34 PM
 - It doesn't matter what you fucking told me. The league settings says November 14. Look it up. 

* Ben Dennis  - 11:20:50 PM
 - Wait there's a trade deadline? I need a RB.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:20:53 PM
 - I just checked the app. It says Nov 14. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:20:58 PM
 - Don't be a little bitch. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:21:14 PM
 - Hillman is available. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:21:16 PM
 - Bro 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:21:28 PM
 - Plus who is peter going to so bench this week 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:21:32 PM
 - If both of you never exsited I would be sooooo happy

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:22:01 PM
 - Bro such a bitch 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:22:03 PM
 - Ali u don't even make sense texting. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:22:05 PM
 - Lynch or Ingram ? 

* Sam Kierstead  - 11:22:18 PM
 - Or if they both died

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:23:06 PM
 - I told you the date but okay 
Whatever 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:23:07 PM
 - Two days ago 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:23:07 PM
 - Yes there is

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:23:11 PM
 - It doesn't matter, Ali. He can decide himself. You want an inside advantage bc you're the commish. And that's bullshit. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:23:14 PM
 - But shut the fuvk up and send the trade 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:23:47 PM
 - Let this trade go through. It's not my fault you didn't check the league settings. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:24:43 PM
 - Shut the fuck up 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:26:33 PM
 - Damn you're annoying 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:26:52 PM
 - Maybe you should look at the fucking settings next year, commish. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:26:55 PM
 - And send the trade 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:27:09 PM
 - Tomorrow is the trade deadline. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:27:19 PM
 - Get your trades in boys!!!

* Ben Dennis  - 11:27:44 PM
 - Hillman is available for a trade or on the wire?

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:27:49 PM
 - Ben, don't worry. Hillman is all yours. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:27:54 PM
 - Shut up 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:27:56 PM
 - Trade. Offer me. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:30:44 PM
 - No lopsided trades allowed 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:30:45 PM
 - If the trade is not fair I'm rejecting the trade 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:32:01 PM
 - You can't reject any fucking trades. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:32:15 PM
 - That's how our league works. No vetos. 

* Eirik Ailee  - 11:33:26 PM
 - Trades should only be rejected if collusion is afoot

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:33:46 PM
 - You shall see 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:34:24 PM
 - Read the rules  dick head  

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:35:32 PM
 - No lopsided trades that's all 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:35:52 PM
 - No lopsided trades 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:37:11 PM
 - Chris send the trade 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:38:39 PM
 - I'm not even trading you cock sucker. It's Peter and David. I'm impartial. And you should be too commish. No trade should ever be vetoed unless there's absolute evidence of collusion. And this trade is fair as fuck. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:40:33 PM
 - There's no collision you cock sucker. You just don't want it to go through bc you're playing one of the traders. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:40:47 PM
 - Collusion-*

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:41:09 PM
 - David told me today he doesn't care for the league anymore 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:41:49 PM
 - I don't give a shit what he said about the league. It's a fair trade and just bc one of them is playing you doesn't mean u can reject it. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:41:56 PM
 - Fine take hill 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:42:05 PM
 - Bench Ingram or lynch

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:42:11 PM
 - Better for me 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:42:26 PM
 - He doesn't have to bench shit. He can do whatever he wants. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:42:40 PM
 - Send the trade 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:43:10 PM
 - So your argument is invalid 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:43:59 PM
 - So don't say I'm blocking the trade because I'm facing peter 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:44:07 PM
 - Cause he cabt even use him this week 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:44:11 PM
 - Cocksucker 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:44:30 PM
 - So Get peters dick out your mouth 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:44:50 PM
 - I'll say whatever I fucking want cock sucker. You went on a power trip. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:46:32 PM
 - Anyway send the trade 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:47:09 PM
 - I'll accept it 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:47:32 PM
 - It's already sent!

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:49:56 PM
 - Seriously bro 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:50:04 PM
 - Don't question my character bro 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:50:18 PM
 - You're drunk and out of it 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:50:29 PM
 - It's better you shut the fuck up 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:51:00 PM
 - Lucky for you I'm not drunk I'm just keeping your power in check. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:51:00 PM
 - I made a mistake and thought the deadline was on the 12th 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:51:18 PM
 - It's ok bro. I still love you. We all make mistakes. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:51:39 PM
 - This trade literally has nothing to do with me. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:51:56 PM
 - Fuck and go suck peters dick 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:52:01 PM
 - But no one vetoes trades in our league. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:52:04 PM
 - No one. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:52:25 PM
 - Trades are between the two people involved. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:52:28 PM
 - I will

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:52:33 PM
 - Send the trade again and shut the fuck up 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:52:36 PM
 - Not the commish. Not anyone else. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:53:29 PM
 - Ali, get off your phone and help Ali (girl) clean up the bar. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:53:37 PM
 - I veto the trade

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:54:01 PM
 - No you dont. Don't be a cock sucker. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:54:01 PM
 - Its unfair and should not be accepted

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:55:33 PM
 - And back to back champion I decree this trade vetoed

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:55:37 PM
 - As*

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:55:46 PM
 - Ali, it's been proposed forever. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:56:39 PM
 - Just send the trade please my mistake I thought the deadline ended two days ago 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:56:40 PM
 - You have absolutely no say Jorge. Your opinion means dick. It means jack shit. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:56:56 PM
 - It's been sent!

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:57:00 PM
 - But I was wrong 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:57:16 PM
 - That's ok Ali. It's ok. It's been sent for days. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:57:49 PM
 - I 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:58:54 PM
 - I rejected the trade thinking the deadline had passed 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:59:16 PM
 - As a champion I should be treated as a champion

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:59:45 PM
 - It's still pending!!!

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:59:53 PM
 - That was Peter.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 12:00:40 AM
 - It's the fucking principle!!!

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 12:02:28 AM
 - This is not Kings, Jorge. You need to win 3 in a row to make a rule you fucking doucher. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 12:02:58 AM
 - Where's that fuck tard, Joe by the way?

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:17:19 AM

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:25:40 AM
 - Suck dick chris 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:25:53 AM

 - Haha suck my gigantic horse cock Ali. 

* Sam Kierstead  - 12:28:15 AM

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:44:22 AM
 - By the way chris 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:46:58 AM
 - The trade offer was proposed 5 hours ago  not 3 days ago 
Fucker 

* Ali Mehrad  - 12:47:50 AM
 - I'm sorry I meant yesterday 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 9:40:41 AM
 - I may or may not have taken the Bills loss a little hard last night and gotten hammered. Ali is still the worst commish of all time, but it's not his fault the league settings are there for everyone to see and it said Nov 14 trade deadline. Have a good day everyone!

* Jorge Grimm  - 10:03:13 AM
 - Are you done yet?

 - Post office does money orders too. Just FYI.

 - Ya I think you could also get one from the Pony Express too. What do you need a money order for in this day and age? Apple Pay bro

* Ben Dennis  - 1:10:37 PM
 - Late rent payments require that. At some places.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 2:05:38 PM
 - The Commonwealth of VA doesn't accept fucking Apple Pay. Lol

* Jorge Grimm  - 2:22:18 PM
 - The commonwealth of prep set Dre's just got a guy named josh Gordon back

* Jorge Grimm  - 2:23:23 PM
 - Can me justin.... Justin time. Cuz its just in time for the play offs

* Jorge Grimm  - 2:24:40 PM
 - The commonwealth of prep set Dre's just got a guy named josh Gordon back

* Joe Stew  - 3:00:15 PM
 - Idk why you and Ali think that two players who haven't played a single nfl game are gonna just come in and dominate.  They're teams have been playing for 12 weeks without them.  They aren't just gonna come in and drop 30. Especially josh Gordon, the browns run most of the time

* Joe Stew  - 3:00:22 PM
 - This year I meant

* Joe Stew  - 3:01:15 PM
 - Idc we aren't friends this next week I'm gonna beat your ass

* Joe Stew  - 3:01:18 PM
 - At fantasy

* Ali Mehrad  - 3:02:19 PM
 - Lol 

* Ali Mehrad  - 3:27:55 PM
 - Happy josh Gordon day 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 3:38:43 PM
 - One would say they're run heavy bc they don't have anyone to throw to except Hawkins (who finally broke out on Sunday). Cameron is out indefinitely with a concussion (Hoyer's favorite target) and Gordon was obviously out til now. So Gordon is a threat immediately, unless he wasn't working out and was just sitting around smokin all day. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 3:39:32 PM
 - He's also more rested than everyone else

* Jorge Grimm  - 3:39:45 PM
 - He's not banged up at all

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 3:40:37 PM
 - True. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 3:40:52 PM
 - Anyone else just see Jay Gruden call out RGIII?

* Ali Mehrad  - 3:40:57 PM
 - Yea but he missed 12 games 

* Jorge Grimm  - 3:41:59 PM
 - Exactly has 12 games more rest than the rest of the league

* Ali Mehrad  - 3:42:19 PM
 - Tough to comeback from. Especially since the browns are in a playoff race 

* Joe Stew  - 4:13:54 PM
 - I just mean when you're not playing in games, your timing is off with the QB and game flow.  Look at Peyton yesterday, best QB in the league, timing was off and he sucked.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 10:54:32 PM
 - Uh oh Peter...another Bell TD and you could be toast...

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:16:49 PM
 - So close 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:17:12 PM
 - 143 points and I still lose 

* Peter Grimm  - 11:17:12 PM
 - Ben is taking knees. My win is safe this week.

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:17:28 PM
 - Good win peter 

* Peter Grimm  - 11:19:48 PM
 - Thank you sir. I was nervous there for a second.

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:20:05 PM
 - What a matchup. Everyone puts up insane numbers against you Ali. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:24:30 PM
 - Crazy 


--- Nov 18, 2014 ---
* Sloot Vandersloot  - 8:59:26 AM
 - HAHAHAHA suck it Ali!! AP suspended for rest of the year. 

* Joe Stew  - 10:00:42 AM
 - Boom

* Me - 12:35:35 PM
 - Now I'm officially glad I dropped him. Worried there for a minute 


--- Nov 23, 2014 ---
* Peter Grimm  - 9:05:22 PM
 - Wow!

* Ali Mehrad  - 9:05:30 PM
 - Odell motherfucking beckham jr 
What a fucking catch 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 9:05:39 PM
 - Best TD I've ever fucking seen. 


--- Nov 30, 2014 ---
* Sloot Vandersloot  - 5:01:24 PM
 - Can we get some trash talking going? I can't start it bc I'm down by 50, but anyone else?

* Jorge Grimm  - 5:21:48 PM
 - Shut up sloot

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 5:42:58 PM
 - First to worst. Fuck. My. Life. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:00:14 PM
 - Chris thanks for keeping my spot warm 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:00:29 PM
 - Enjoy your matchup next week lol 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:00:42 PM
 - Fuck your fucking Perisian face. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:01:08 PM
 - Roddy White can suck my dick.  

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:01:49 PM
 - Lol 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:02:26 PM
 - Like I could've foreseen an Ellington injury. Fuck you you douche. You'll suck in the playoffs. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:02:30 PM
 - Le'veon bell is a beast 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:02:52 PM
 - Your fucking ass is a beast as I'm fucking it. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:03:27 PM
 - Chris that was a poor effort

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:03:57 PM
 - Yea 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:04:30 PM
 -   Fuck your fucking face Matt Crockett. You're eeking into the playoffs only bc Sam shit the bed. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:05:43 PM
 - And if Caleb Sturgis scores more than 3 points, you're fucking out. So suck my dick. I'm already in the playoffs mother fucker. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:06:23 PM
 - Do I look Asian to you or something?

* Matty Crocket  - 11:07:57 PM
 - And actually even if I lose there's a chance I get in as the highest point total out of people with 6-7 records 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:08:10 PM
 - So learn math plz

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:08:32 PM
 - Nope 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:08:38 PM
 - You learn math. You're out. 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:08:39 PM
 - Just has more points 

* Ben Dennis  - 11:09:29 PM
 - I still have a shot right guys?

* Matty Crocket  - 11:09:56 PM
 - I think you're just using this league to overcompensate for your poor endowment

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:10:19 PM
 - At keeping down douchebag out of the playoffs yes. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:10:23 PM
 - It's kinda sad to watch

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:10:36 PM
 - Keeping some douche bag*

* Matty Crocket  - 11:13:11 PM
 - You're just salty Chris, it's okay

* Matty Crocket  - 11:13:20 PM
 - We're all here for you

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:13:45 PM
 - I'm in the playoffs. Where are you?????

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:13:58 PM
 - Jorge certifiably isn't. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:14:14 PM
 - About to get my dick sucked

* Matty Crocket  - 11:14:20 PM
 - More than can be said for you

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:16:29 PM
 -  You're like 6th you piece of shit. Caleb Sturgis kicks one 40 yard FG tmrw and you're  out your piece of shit. P

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:16:46 PM
 - You're done. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:16:51 PM
 - Wrap it up. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:17:23 PM
 - Tell Peter he better pay his $100 or else mr. Clean will be coming for him. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:17:34 PM
 - Man get this Chris guy a drink his life must suck

* Matty Crocket  - 11:17:37 PM
 - Next one's on me buddy

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:18:13 PM
 - Avoiding my texts 

* Ali Mehrad  - 11:18:32 PM
 - Maybe I need to make a trip downtown lol 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:18:34 PM
 - Don't you dare you fuck. 

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:18:51 PM
 - Come on down. Your lineup will never be set. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:19:19 PM
 - Ali could kick your ass Chris

* Matty Crocket  - 11:19:22 PM
 - He's a scrappy fucker

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:20:19 PM
 - He weighs 74 lbs. Eirher way it doesn't matter bc you're out of the playoffs and all of us are in. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:21:26 PM
 - Man good thing I don't base my personal value on the outcome of a fantasy league. Otherwise I might actually be upset

* Matty Crocket  - 11:21:40 PM
 - You'll grow up one day Chris, keep on truckin

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:21:48 PM
 - Yeah seriously. You'd be about to kill yourself.  

* Matty Crocket  - 11:21:57 PM
 - The next leap might be the leap home

* Matty Crocket  - 11:22:30 PM
 - It'd be easier to kill you than kill myself

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:22:34 PM
 - Good thing I'm in 2nd place and in the playoffs. Maybe you'll do better in the consolation bracket. 

* Matty Crocket  - 11:23:26 PM
 - Man good thing I don't base my personal value on the outcome of a fantasy league. Otherwise I might actually be upset

* Matty Crocket  - 11:23:30 PM
 - Man it's gunna really suck when Joe's team double penetrates your ass and dick hole

* Matty Crocket  - 11:23:47 PM
 - The latter will be especially painful

* Sloot Vandersloot  - 11:23:53 PM
 - HAHAHAHA. You're cute. 

* Jorge Grimm  - 11:25:47 PM
 - Yaaay smack talk
